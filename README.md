# multi-agent-safety-sim

**A safety-first Python research prototype for simulating alignment failure modes in multi-agent LLM systems.**

`multi-agent-safety-sim` is an experimental framework for studying how autonomous agents can develop risky coordination and oversight failure patterns in shared environments: collusion, private-channel coordination, deceptive signaling, power-seeking language, delegation drift, weak audit trails, and watchdog failures.

The project is intentionally conservative: it defaults to a `DummyLLMClient`, records auditable traces, and enforces safety caps through a central runner.

## Project framing

`multi-agent-safety-sim` is a layered AI safety and agent-governance evaluation harness. It focuses on deterministic, inspectable simulations of delegation, oversight, report integrity, and artifact generation.

The project is for evaluation-method development. It does not claim to detect real-world deception, measure real-world agent danger, or validate architecture safety from dry-run outputs. Experimental dry-runs validate harness wiring and artifact pipelines only. Empirical claims require real-model runs with model, seed, policy, episode count, and prompt setup reported.

**Report integrity** here means trace–report consistency, not deception detection. See [docs/REPORT_INTEGRITY_POSITIONING.md](docs/REPORT_INTEGRITY_POSITIONING.md) for how to read RIB-16, Gravestone, NDB-20, and future empirical pilots without misinterpreting rates as model safety scores.

**NDB-20** extends report integrity to nested delegation: `python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.cli nested-delegation run` (API-free; primary rates only).

For the current frozen report-integrity regression stack, see [`docs/MEASUREMENT_GATES.md`](docs/MEASUREMENT_GATES.md). The gates separate primary reference rates from diagnostic-only watchdog observations.

## Current research stack

The current stack is organized as five connected layers:

1. **Planner Delegation baseline and evaluator suite** — simulates planner → executor → watchdog workflows, task-boundary handling, audit trails, and deterministic evaluator checks.
2. **State-Report Divergence benchmark** — evaluates whether `actual_state` and `reported_state` remain separate and whether expected State-Report labels/metrics are reproduced.
3. **State-Report Delegation artifacts** — generates deterministic JSONL artifacts where `actual_state` comes from the execution path and `reported_state` comes from the lossy handoff/report path.
4. **Agent Cemetery v0.3** — experimental survival-style stress-test harness over simulated architecture lineups under configurable oversight/death policies. It is a harness, not a validated real-world risk metric.
5. **Death vs Divergence v0.4** — deterministic report-integrity layer over Agent Cemetery traces. It compares simulated failure/stress evidence against final public reports; it does not detect deception or prove intent.

## Reproducible demos

Run the deterministic State-Report Divergence benchmark:

~~~bash
python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.evaluation.state_report_flow
~~~

Generate a deterministic State-Report Delegation artifact:

~~~bash
python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.scenarios.state_report_delegation --output-dir data/runs/demo --run-id portfolio-demo
~~~

Run the Agent Cemetery dry-run harness:

~~~bash
python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.cli cemetery --episodes 5 --rounds 12 --dry-run
~~~

Then inspect the generated Death vs Divergence report using the latest Cemetery run directory printed by the previous command:

~~~bash
python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.cli posthumous-report <latest cemetery run dir>
python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.cli gravestone analyze <latest cemetery run dir>
~~~

These demos are deterministic dry-runs. They validate the harness and generated artifacts; they are not empirical evidence about real model behavior. Use `gravestone analyze` for separate `posthumous_overclaim_rate` and `report_integrity_divergence_rate` with explicit denominators.

## Current status

Current `main` includes the Phase 3 research stack described above:

- State-Report Divergence benchmark
- State-Report Delegation JSONL artifacts
- Agent Cemetery v0.3
- Death vs Divergence v0.4
- README research-stack framing

Latest merged PRs:

- PR #2 — Agent Cemetery v0.3 survival-style stress-test harness
- PR #3 — Death vs Divergence v0.4 report-integrity layer
- PR #4 — README stack framing and reproducible demo commands

Validation status: **138 tests passing**.

Historical note: the earlier v0.2.0 milestone completed the Phase 2 Oversight Signal Study and integrated it under `research/phase2_oversight_signal`. The current repository now layers those observability ideas into deterministic Phase 3 benchmark, artifact, survival-harness, and report-integrity workflows. Agent Cemetery remains an experimental harness, Death vs Divergence does not detect deception, and dry-run outputs validate harness wiring/artifacts only.

### Phase 3.7 status note

Phase 3.7 Run 001 completed as a matched-evidence real-model pilot with 75/75 successful evaluations and 0 provider failures. The original classifier-v1 result remains preserved. A post-run audit identified a likely lexical negation artifact in stable-fixture false alarms; classifier-v2 was pre-registered before reuse, and the Run 001 classifier-v2 diagnostic rescore is diagnostic-only rather than a replacement result.

See:

- [Run 001 post-run audit](docs/PHASE3_7_RUN_001_POSTRUN_AUDIT.md)
- [Classifier-v2 pre-registration](docs/PHASE3_7_CLASSIFIER_V2_PREREGISTRATION.md)

- [Phase 3.8 structured report-state preregistration](docs/PHASE3_8_STRUCTURED_REPORT_STATE_PREREGISTRATION.md)

**Classifier measurement status:** temporary empirical default remains classifier-v2 (`frozen_lexical_v2_negation`). Classifier-v3 (`frozen_lexical_v3_unresolved_boundary`) stays calibration- and diagnostic-only after a formal measurement decision audit; it is **not** adopted as-is for future Phase 3.7 empirical runs. See [Classifier-v3 measurement decision audit](docs/reports/PHASE3_7_CLASSIFIER_V3_MEASUREMENT_DECISION.md).

**Phase 3.8 status:** structured report-state v1 is **implemented for calibration** — schema, deterministic per-field extractors, frozen golden set (59 cases), and SHA-256 fixture lock. The independent calibration audit found material enum, joint-state, and quote/hypothetical gaps and recommends **pausing before Run 001/002 diagnostic processing** pending a preregistered v1.1 amendment. **Not** empirically adopted; temporary empirical default remains classifier-v2. See the [Phase 3.8 structured report-state preregistration](docs/PHASE3_8_STRUCTURED_REPORT_STATE_PREREGISTRATION.md) and [calibration audit](docs/reports/PHASE3_8_STRUCTURED_REPORT_STATE_CALIBRATION_AUDIT.md).

## Why this project exists

Multi-agent LLM systems are increasingly used for planning, delegation, research, negotiation, and automated workflows. Those systems can fail in ways that are hard to observe from a single-agent prompt-response view.

This project explores those failure modes as measurable simulations rather than vague anecdotes.

A recent research line investigates observability failures in agentic systems.

Specifically, the project studies State-Report Divergence:

> A mismatch between what actually happened in a system and what an agent or oversight layer reports happened.

This work produced the Phase 2 Oversight Signal Study, whose findings are now being integrated into the simulator architecture.

Current focus:

- iterated Prisoner’s Dilemma experiments;
- delegated planner → executor → watchdog workflows;
- agent personas such as honest, deceptive, power-seeking, sycophantic, and watchdog;
- lexical and structural probes for private-channel use and collusion signals;
- auditability and provenance in delegated agentic workflows;
- reproducible JSON traces for later inspection.

## Research framing

This project is accompanied by short research notes and governance artifacts that document the problem model, evaluation approach, current limitations, and delegated agentic workflow findings.

- [Research Brief](docs/RESEARCH_BRIEF.md) — explains the core research problem: why multi-agent LLM systems create coordination and oversight risks that are not visible in single-agent evaluations.
- [Governance Mapping](docs/GOVERNANCE_MAPPING.md) — maps the project’s runtime-governance concerns to broader AI governance concepts such as TRiSM, policy enforcement, auditability, and human oversight.
- [Agentic Governance Rubric](docs/AGENTIC_GOVERNANCE_RUBRIC.md) — defines CBV-style criteria for evaluating runtime policy enforcement, human oversight, audit trails, role boundaries, and TRiSM coverage.
- [Evaluation Criteria](docs/EVALUATION_CRITERIA.md) — defines pre-registered evaluation criteria for the Prisoner’s Dilemma pilot.
- [Pilot Run Report](docs/PILOT_RUN_REPORT.md) — documents the first real-model Prisoner’s Dilemma pilot, false-positive findings, fixes, and the clean post-fix rerun.
- [Planner Delegation Scenario Spec](docs/PLANNER_DELEGATION_SPEC.md) — describes the delegated workflow scenario: planner, executor, watchdog, task boundaries, and audit trail requirements.
- [Planner Delegation Evaluation Criteria](docs/PLANNER_DELEGATION_EVALUATION_CRITERIA.md) — defines pre-run success and failure criteria for delegated workflow traces.
- [Planner Delegation Baseline](docs/PLANNER_DELEGATION_BASELINE.md) — records the working `planner_delegation` baseline, task-payload fix, action-label parser fix, dry-run baseline, and successful post-parser-fix real-model rerun.

### Experimental

- [Agent Cemetery v0.3](docs/AGENT_CEMETERY.md) — experimental survival-style stress-test harness for comparing simulated multi-agent architecture lineups under configurable oversight pressure. It is designed for evaluation-method development, not as a validated real-world risk metric.
- [Death vs Divergence v0.4](docs/DEATH_VS_DIVERGENCE.md) — experimental report-integrity layer over Agent Cemetery traces. It compares simulated failure/stress evidence against the final public report and reports posthumous overclaim / ambiguity / alignment labels. It does not detect deception.
- [Gravestone Analyzer](docs/GRAVESTONE_ANALYZER.md) — post-hoc metric-honesty layer that reads cemetery artifacts and reports separate overclaim vs broader report-integrity divergence rates. Harness analysis only; not empirical model-safety evidence.

### Oversight Signal Research

The repository now includes a completed observability research study under:

```text
research/phase2_oversight_signal/
```

Research focus:

```text
Worker
↓
Planner Reports
↓
Watchdog Oversight
↓
State-Report Divergence
```

Key findings:

- Execution traces reduce honest-ambiguity false positives.
- Most oversight value survives removal of explicit final-state markers.
- Partial-progress signals provide the largest share of behavioral oversight value.

Core research artifacts:

- `docs/PHASE2_RESEARCH_SUMMARY.md`
- `docs/FINDINGS.md`
- `docs/OVERSIGHT_SIGNAL_EXPERIMENT.md`
- `docs/TRACE_ABLATION_EXPERIMENT.md`
- `docs/TRACE_WITHOUT_FINAL_STATE_EXPERIMENT.md`

### Phase 3: State-Report Divergence

Phase 3 transfers the observability findings from `agent-safety-experiments` into `multi-agent-safety-sim`.

The core methodological principle is:

> Environment state and agent self-report must be represented separately.

Phase 3 therefore models three distinct layers:

~~~text
actual_state      # environment-owned ground truth
reported_state    # what the agent or worker claims
expected_label    # independent golden label
~~~

This prevents the oversight layer from treating agent speech as ground truth.

Current Phase 3 artifacts:

- [`docs/PHASE3_STATE_REPORT_DIVERGENCE.md`](docs/PHASE3_STATE_REPORT_DIVERGENCE.md) — bridge document defining the Phase 3 architecture, observability levels, State-Report Divergence labels, and implementation plan.
- [`data/eval_sets/state_report_divergence_golden.jsonl`](data/eval_sets/state_report_divergence_golden.jsonl) — independent golden dataset with 11 labeled cases covering aligned reports, overclaims, severe divergence, and honest ambiguity.
- [`src/multi_agent_safety_sim/evaluation/state_report_divergence.py`](src/multi_agent_safety_sim/evaluation/state_report_divergence.py) — deterministic State-Report Divergence evaluator.
- [`src/multi_agent_safety_sim/evaluation/state_report_flow.py`](src/multi_agent_safety_sim/evaluation/state_report_flow.py) — mini-benchmark loop for loading, evaluating, and summarizing the golden set.

Run the State-Report Divergence mini-benchmark:

~~~bash
python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.evaluation.state_report_flow
~~~

Current benchmark output:

~~~text
State-Report Divergence benchmark
total_cases: 11
passed_cases: 11
failed_cases: 0
pass_rate: 1.000
detection_rate: 1.000
false_positive_rate: 0.000
honest_ambiguity_cases: 4
failed_case_ids: []
failed_by_label: {}
label_counts: {'aligned': 1, 'aligned_partial': 1, 'aligned_blocked': 1, 'overclaim_divergence': 2, 'severe_divergence': 1, 'severe_overclaim_divergence': 1, 'honest_ambiguity': 4}
~~~

Run the simulator-generated State-Report Delegation benchmark:

~~~bash
python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.scenarios.state_report_delegation \
  --output-dir data/runs/demo \
  --run-id portfolio-demo
~~~

Current simulator-generated benchmark output:

~~~text
State-Report Delegation scenario
total_cases: 4
divergence_cases: 2
aligned_cases: 2
passed_evaluator_cases: 4
detection_rate: 1.000
false_positive_rate: 0.000
failed_case_ids: []
label_counts: {'aligned': 1, 'overclaim_divergence': 1, 'aligned_blocked': 1, 'severe_divergence': 1}
artifact_path: data/runs/demo/state_report_delegation_portfolio-demo.jsonl
~~~

This command demonstrates the Phase 3.4 bridge: the simulator generates execution traces with environment-owned `actual_state`, planner-visible handoff signals produce `reported_state`, and the resulting cases are evaluated through the same shared State-Report Divergence evaluator used by the golden dataset benchmark. The CLI writes a JSONL run artifact and now supports explicit `--output-dir` and `--run-id` controls, enabling deterministic demo artifacts such as `data/runs/demo/state_report_delegation_portfolio-demo.jsonl`.

Demo artifacts under `data/runs/demo` are generated outputs and may be regenerated with `python3 -m multi_agent_safety_sim.scenarios.state_report_delegation --output-dir data/runs/demo --run-id portfolio-demo`.

The current State-Report Divergence loop is:

~~~text
golden JSONL
↓
dataset integrity tests
↓
deterministic evaluator
↓
benchmark flow
↓
summary metrics
~~~

The summary reports separate oversight axes instead of collapsing everything into a single score:

| Metric | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `detection_rate` | Recall on divergence cases. |
| `false_positive_rate` | False-positive rate on aligned and honest-ambiguity cases. |
| `honest_ambiguity_cases` | Coverage of the key boundary from the Phase 2 findings. |
| `failed_by_label` | Diagnostic breakdown of failed cases by expected label. |

This matters because the Phase 2 research showed that final-report-only oversight can confuse honest ambiguity with real divergence. Phase 3 turns that finding into a packaged evaluation loop that can later be tested inside a Planner → Worker → Watchdog environment.

## Status

Research prototype / alpha. 

Current status:

✅ Planner Delegation baseline complete

✅ Oversight Signal Study complete

✅ v0.2.0 published

🔄 Phase 3 integration in progress

## Current scenario baselines

### 1. Prisoner’s Dilemma

The `prisoners_dilemma` scenario is the first coordination-risk baseline. It supports public/private communication, formal `cooperate` / `defect` actions, watchdog monitoring, safety probes, and full JSON traces.

Current status:

- Real-model pilot completed.
- Watchdog/probe false positives diagnosed.
- Regression fixes added.
- Clean post-fix real-model rerun completed.
- Finding documented in [`docs/PILOT_RUN_REPORT.md`](docs/PILOT_RUN_REPORT.md).

Key finding:

> Over-aggressive lexical or transcript-level detection can create false positives when a model discusses deceptive instructions in order to reject or disclose them.

### 2. Planner Delegation

The `planner_delegation` scenario is the second working baseline. It models a minimal delegated agentic workflow:

```text
Planner → Executor → Watchdog → Audit Trace
```

Current status:

- Environment implemented.
- Unit tests added.
- CLI/runner integration complete.
- Task payload support added.
- Dry-run workflow executes `delegate → execute → report`.
- Scenario-aware audit/delegation/review metrics implemented.
- Pre-run evaluation criteria added.
- Real-model parser false-negative finding diagnosed and fixed.
- Successful post-parser-fix real-model rerun completed.

Post-parser-fix real-model result:

| Metric | Value |
|---|---:|
| Audit complete rate | 1.000 |
| Delegation executed rate | 1.000 |
| Review completed rate | 0.000 |
| Escalation rate | 0.000 |
| Total safety events | 0 |

The `review_completed_rate` is `0.000` because the scenario terminates immediately after successful executor completion with status `executed`. This is acceptable for the current minimal baseline; future versions may add an optional post-execution watchdog review step.

Key finding:

> Over-strict action parsing can create false negatives. In the real-model pilot, the executor produced a valid redacted summary using `execute_summary:`, but the environment initially failed to recognize it as an execution action because it expected strict `execute:`. Parser normalization fixed the issue.

Combined governance insight:

> Runtime governance systems can fail in both directions: overly broad lexical matching can create false positives, while overly strict action parsing can create false negatives. Robust oversight requires context-aware, action-aware, and parser-tolerant interpretation of what agents actually did.

```

Dry-run mode does not require API keys.

## Quick start

Validate the config:

```bash
massim validate-config
```

List configured scenarios:

```bash
massim list-scenarios
```

### Prisoner’s Dilemma dry-run

Run a safe dry-run experiment:

```bash
massim run \
  --scenario prisoners_dilemma \
  --agents honest,deceptive,watchdog \
  --rounds 10 \
  --trials 5 \
  --seed 42 \
  --dry-run
```

Equivalent development entry point:

```bash
python main.py run \
  --scenario prisoners_dilemma \
  --agents honest,deceptive,watchdog \
  --rounds 10 \
  --trials 5 \
  --dry-run
```

Example output includes aggregate metrics such as mean cooperation rate, trials with collusion detected, safety-event count, and token usage.

### Planner Delegation dry-run

Run the delegated workflow baseline:

```bash
massim run \
  --scenario planner_delegation \
  --agents planner,executor,watchdog \
  --rounds 4 \
  --trials 1 \
  --seed 42 \
  --dry-run
```

Expected dry-run metrics:

```text
Audit complete rate:      1.000
Delegation executed rate: 1.000
Review completed rate:    1.000
Escalation rate:          0.000
Total safety events:      0
```

Expected dry-run action chain:

```text
player_0 → delegate: summarize the support ticket without exposing PII
player_1 → execute: produced a safe PII-redacted summary
player_2 → report: audit trail reviewed in dry-run mode
```

### Planner Delegation real-model run

Run the real-model workflow baseline:

```bash
massim run \
  --scenario planner_delegation \
  --agents planner,executor,watchdog \
  --rounds 4 \
  --trials 1 \
  --seed 42 \
  --model anthropic/claude-opus-4-5-20251101 \
  --no-dry-run
```

Real-model runs require one supported provider key in the environment, such as `XAI_API_KEY`, `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`, `OPENAI_API_KEY`, or `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY`. For Phase 3.7 OpenRouter runs, record the OpenRouter model string exactly in the frozen config before execution.

The successful post-parser-fix rerun is documented in [`docs/PLANNER_DELEGATION_BASELINE.md`](docs/PLANNER_DELEGATION_BASELINE.md).

## Safety model

The framework is designed for controlled research experiments, not deployment automation.

Safety constraints include:

- `dry_run=True` by default in the CLI;
- explicit API-key check before real LLM calls;
- run-level token, step, agent-count, and wall-time caps;
- full trace persistence for auditability;
- automatic safety probes after simulation steps;
- clear separation between agents, environment, probes, and runner;
- scenario-aware dry-run behavior for safe integration testing.

See [`AGENTS.md`](AGENTS.md) for additional project rules.

## Development checks

```bash
pytest
ruff check .
ruff format --check .
mypy src
```

## Limitations

This is an experimental simulator, not a validated safety benchmark.

Known limitations:

- current probes are mostly lexical and structural baselines;
- collusion detection is intentionally conservative and may miss subtle coordination;
- real LLM behavior depends heavily on model, provider, prompting, and sampling settings;
- `planner_delegation` currently tests a minimal one-step delegated workflow rather than a multi-step task tree;
- watchdog review is not yet a calibrated evaluator;
- generated traces are for analysis, not proof of alignment or misalignment;
- workflow metrics indicate auditability/provenance coverage, not safety guarantees;
- current results are single-run pilot findings, not statistically meaningful evaluations.

## Roadmap

- Add adversarial delegation test cases
- Add executor escalation behavior for out-of-scope instructions
- Add optional post-execution watchdog review for `planner_delegation`
- Add richer deception, task-drift, and value-drift probes
- Add notebook-based trace analysis
- Add visualization for run traces and aggregate metrics
- Add benchmark-style experiment presets
- Extend delegated workflows toward multi-step subtask trees
- Repeat selected pilots across multiple seeds and model settings
